Traceva

A Zero-Trace Modular Protocol for Privacy-Native Web3

📌 Overview

Traceva is a modular, privacy-first protocol that combines zero-knowledge proofs, encrypted communication, and decentralized autonomy. It provides a suite of tools for private identity, secure communication, and stealth financial operations across multiple chains.

Core modules:

🔑 Traceva ID – Self-sovereign encrypted identity

💬 Traceva Chat – Onchain verifiable encrypted messenger

💸 Traceva Pay – Private cross-chain payments

🎁 Traceva Drop – Stealth asset distribution

🔐 Traceva Vault – Encrypted file & credential storage

🧩 Traceva Access – Privacy-native access control

🤖 Traceva Agent – AI assistant (General + Blockchain mode)

⚡ Traceva Payment (Multi-Chain Support)

Traceva Pay is designed as a privacy-preserving payment router. It ensures that transaction details are encrypted, metadata-free, and verifiable onchain.

🔹 Architecture

User Wallet → Traceva Layer

A user signs and encrypts payment instructions.

Data is routed through Traceva’s zero-knowledge layer.

Traceva Layer → Chain Execution

Instructions are verified with zero-knowledge proofs.

No metadata (sender, receiver patterns) is leaked.

Onchain Settlement

Payment is executed on the chosen blockchain.

Currently supports Ethereum and BNB Chain.

🔹 BNB Chain Support

Traceva Pay integrates natively with BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20).

This enables fast, low-fee, private transactions while maintaining verifiability.

Cross-chain routing between Ethereum ↔ BNB Chain is handled through encrypted relayers and ZK proofs, ensuring seamless settlement.
